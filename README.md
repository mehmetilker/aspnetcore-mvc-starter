# aspnetcore-mvc-starter

*Created with Visual Studio 2017 RC Standart MVC Core 1.0 Template*

Still in development. Further explanations will be provided after some technical problems will be solved. Problems are mostly based on missing technical documentation and half baked solutions in context of .Net Core Framework + MVC Core library.



Standart Visual Studio Mvc project template creates confusion especially on the subjects "Dependency Injection" and Model.

Solution template aims providing better approach / how it could be rather than how it should be, while making easy understanding and comprehension of developing loosly coupled solution.


###Standart template creates confusion on the using of;

  *Membership/Identity library: Developed on Asp.net namespace and it looks inseperable from web project.
  *Data Context<br>
  *Model and Entity concepts<br>
  *Tight coupled models (dependency on Identity Entities)<br>
  *Dependecy Injection : Gives examples only on Message service.<br>
  *Single resposibility (Especially on controller usage)<br>
  *Testing<br>

###How to extend;

*Unit testing<br>
*Integration testing
*Api for mobile app integratino
*Identity for Api
