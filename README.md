# aspnetcore-mvc-starter

Created with Visual Studio 2017 RC Standart MVC Core 1.0 Template

Still in development. Further explanations will be provided after some technical problems will be solved. Problems are mostly based on missing technical documentation and half baked solutions in context of .Net Core Framework + MVC Core library.



Standart Visual Studio Mvc project template creates confusion especially on the subjects "Dependency Injection" and Model.

Solution template aims providing better approach insteading of standart template while making easy understanding and comprehension of developing loosyl coupled solution.

Standart template creates confusion on the using of;
-Membership/Identity library: Developed on Asp.net namespace and it looks inseperable from web project.
-Data Context
-Dependecy Injection : Gives examples only on Message service.
